2.x Road Map
============

Server:

 * Using sessions code, have machines initially register with a
   hash, rather than hostname checking
 * set/get Bcfgs Dept strings
    * Done, the bcfg2.init and bcfg2.url attributes

Client:

 * A --configure or similar option to pull the Bcfg2 init string
   and run bcfg2 in the proper incatation to initially configure the
   machine?  Optional --dept and/or --password
    * Done: this is its own tool now called ncsubootstrap
