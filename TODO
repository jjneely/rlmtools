Road Map
============

Server:

3.0.x:

    * Solve the bazillian MySQL connections problem
    * Port away from mod_python (unmaintained)
        nginx ??
        uWSGI ??
        apache + mod_wsgi ??
    * Celery real time and scheduled tasks?
        http://www.celeryproject.org/

2.1.x:

    * Re-work the UI so that all Admin Panels become "Manage Attributes"
      or similar.  Be able to drill down to all dept and client status
      pages from the Front Page.
    * Each status page should clearly link to the Manage Attributes
      page for that dept/client
    * MA pages should not be under the Administration tab
    * Administration tab shows overview of Realm Linux access perms
    * Admin tabs allow you to link together, create, delete, alter
      Realm Linux access permissions

        * Web-Kickstart
        * PTS Groups
        * RHN
        * Red Hat KB accounts
        * Departments
        * Bcfg2 Repos

    * Create a plugin style system for managing access permissions
        - No.  There is a lot of variability.  Let's get working
          cron jobs and web pages first.
    * Create -inators for cron jobs to process queue of actions to
      alter or create PTS groups, depts, web-kickstart dirs, etc.
