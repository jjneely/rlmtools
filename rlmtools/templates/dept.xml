    Clients are categorized into Supported and Non-Supported.  A Supported
    client is configured with Web-Kickstart and <i>may</i> meet the
    requirements for official support.  Non-Supported clients are unknown
    clients.  Its possible that something has happened to a supported
    client to make it lose its supported status such as removing the
    client's config file from AFS, hostname changes, not installed with
    Web-Kickstart, etc.  
  </p>
  <p>
    Clients are flagged as red due to error or when the client hasn't 
    checked in for 7 days.  Click on the host for more information.
  </p>
  <p>
    If a client is unsupported it can be marked as supported by running
    the <tt>ncsubless</tt> command line tool as your realm user on the
    machine in question.
