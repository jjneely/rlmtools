    Below is a summary of your Access Control Lists as Liquid Dragon
    knows them.  ACLs are based upon AFS PTS groups.  These ACLs give you
    access to departments.  A department has several permissions associated
    with it, such as a Web-Kickstart directory in AFS and RHN access.

  <h2>Liquid Dragon ACLs</h2>

  <p>
    You may manage the Access Control Lists for RLMTools (code name
    Liquid Dragon) from the 
    <a href="${baseURL}/perms/acl/">Liquid Dragon ACLs</a>
    page.  This allows you to set which ACLs govern access to 
    specific departments and their children.
