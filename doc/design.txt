Problems:
  * Maintain an authoritative list of all Realm Linux clients including
    (and so denoted) supported clients.
  * Monitor output of specific scripts like up2date and client.py rather
    than email output to me
  * Allow campus community to view reports

Existing Code:
   * Existing code supplies support for identifing trusted clients and
     distributing a specific file.
   * Web-Kickstart initializes a row for each client to log that this
     client will be supported once it generates and uploads a key.  This
     needs to be altered slightly so that non-trusted clients can be in
     the database as well.
   * ncsubless functionality - trust the machine because a trusted admin
     told us to
