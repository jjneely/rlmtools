Configuration of Apache and RLMTools
====================================

Right now the XMLRPC client calls URL/handler.py and the URL maps to the
directory that this tarball/project is in.  The handler.py file is actually
not in this directory but the rlmtools/ directory.  That's what we want
for now.  I've included an .htaccess file that looks like this:

AddHandler python-program .py
PythonHandler rlmtools.handler
PythonDebug On
PythonInterpPerDirectory On

<Files solaris2ks.conf>
    deny from all
</Files>

That will start the handler.py script via mod_python when and URL is used that
looks like URL/*.py.  

This code base imports the Web-Kickstart code and uses that and
Web-Kickstart's configuration to find its database and pull client
configuration from the Web-Kickstart config files.  Therefore, Web-Kickstart
needs to know where its config file solaris2ks.conf lives.  This can either be
in the current directory (the top level in this project) or in 
/etc/solaris2ks.conf.

CherryPy Setup
==============

Well need some Location configs for this.  Which probably means we should
setup the XMLRPC interface with some location config files to.
