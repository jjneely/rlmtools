Configuration of Apache and RLMTools
====================================

The XMLRPC server is the module rlmtools.handler and is now designed to
be run fron your Apache configuration via Location diretives.  An example
config:

<Location /xmlrpc/handler.py >
        SetHandler python-program
        PythonHandler rlmtools.handler
        PythonPath "sys.path + ['/extra/python/path']"
        PythonInterpreter rlmtools

        PythonOption rlmtools.configfile /path/to/configuration
</Location>

The top level rlmtools/ directory must be in the python path as well as
the top level webkickstart/ directory.  Hopefully, these are provided
by handy RPM packages in the site-packages area of your python
distribution.

The code looks in /etc/rlmtools.conf to find the following 4 options in 
a [db] section: host, user, passwd, db.  Also, [main] must include 'logfile' 
and 'log_level'.  The log level should be set to 1 for everything, 10 for
normal operations.  You can override the location of the config file by 
using the PythonOption "rlmtools.configfile", otherwise it is optional.

The rest of the configuration RLMTools uses is stored inside the database.  Use
the CLI in configDragon.py to insert configuration and check the configuration
for completeness.

The Web-Kickstart code is used to pull client configuration information
from the client's Web-Kickstart config file.  The configDragon.py script will
ask for the location of the Web-Kickstart configration directory.  The 
default is /etc/webkickstart.  Make sure that directory is set properly.


CherryPy Setup
==============

The CherryPy framework runs the web application that users can see.  It can
run with the CherryPy standalone web server or through Apache with 
mod_python using the WSGI gateway that I've included.  It also makes use
of NCSU's WRAP authentication which is only available via Apache and the
WRAP module.  The following configuration will get the web interface
going on /rlmtools.  Note that the app expects to be mounted in that location
so if that changes you'll need to edit the source.

The PythonPath option basically lets python know in what directory the
rlmtools module/package is if its not installed in your Python path.

<Location /rlmtools>
    PythonPath "sys.path + ['/root/ncsu-rlmtools']"
                            
    SetHandler python-program
    PythonHandler modpython_gateway::handler
    PythonOption wsgi.application cherrypy._cpwsgi::wsgiApp
    PythonOption wsgi.startup rlmtools.webapp::wsgi
    PythonOption SCRIPT_NAME /rlmtools

    PythonOption rlmtools.configfile /path/to/configuration

    AuthType WRAP
    require affiliation ncsu.edu
    require known-user
</Location>

The PythonOption for "rlmtools.configfile" is optional and can be used
to specify a file to read for the initial configuration.
