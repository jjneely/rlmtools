Schema
======

The current schema is kept in the directory above in a file named
'schema.sql'.  This application is desinged specifically to work with MySQL
4.1 or better.  The InnoDB store engine is preferred but this code does
not require it.

Upgrading to the New Schema
---------------------------

Import the SQL dump of the below schema if you are changing databases.

SQL Commands:

 * rename table realmlinux to oldrl;

Import the schema from schema.sql to the database.

SQL Commands:

 * update oldrl set dept = 'unknown' where isnull(dept);
 * insert into dept (name) select distinct dept from oldrl 
   where dept != 'unknown';
 * insert into realmlinux (hostname, installdate, recvdkey, publickey,
   dept_id, version, support) select o.hostname, o.installdate,
   o.recvdkey, o.publickey, d.dept_id, o.version, 1
   from oldrl as o, dept as d where d.name = o.dept;
 * insert into lastheard (host_id, timestamp) select r.host_id, o.lastcheck
   from realmlinux as r, oldrl as o where r.hostname = o.hostname;


Original Schema
===============

CREATE TABLE realmlinux (
    hostname    VARCHAR(255),
    installdate DATETIME,
    recvdkey    TINYINT,
    publickey   TEXT,
    lastcheck   DATETIME,
    dept        VARCHAR(32),
    version     VARCHAR(32)
);
