NOTES
=====

For the Puppet integration to work we need something like the following in
the /etc/puppet/puppet.conf file to loosen the permissions on the Puppet
x509 certs/keys

[agent]
# explicitly set the permissions of this tree to readable by anyone in the puppet group
privatekeydir = /var/lib/puppet/ssl/private_keys { owner = puppet, group = puppet, mode = 750 }

# The default value is '$privatekeydir/$certname.pem'.
hostprivkey = $privatekeydir/$certname.pem { owner = puppet, group = puppet, mode = 640 }
