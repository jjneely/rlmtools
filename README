Realm Linux Management Tools AKA Project Liquid Dragon
======================================================

These are tools to manage NCSU's deployment of Realm Linux and integrate
it with our environment secrets, configuration management tools, and
generall be the One Ring to bind them all together.

This code is licensed under the GNU General Public License version 2 or,
at your option, and greater version.  You are welcome to use this code
elsewhere and send in patches and suggestions.

Requirements
------------

Web-Kickstart, an NCSU tool to generate dynamic Red Hat Kickstarts.

    https://secure.linux.ncsu.edu/moin/WebKickstart

Also: python-cherrypy, python-genshi, python-ezpycrypto, MySQL-python
      rrdtool-python, mod_python

New Requirements: pyliblzma, flask, flask-xmlrpc

Basic Installation
------------------

* You'll need a MySQL server running someplace.

* Import the initial schema found in schema/schema.sql to your new DB

* Create /etc/rlmtools.conf with the details of the database.  Example:

[main]
logfile = /var/log/rlmtools.log
log_level = 1 

[db]
host = localhost
user = realmlinux
db = realmlinux
passwd = foobarbaz

* Run python rlmtools/configDrago.py

This will prompt you for the rest of the configuration needed that is
stored in the database.  It will ask where your Web-Kickstart configs
directory lives (/etc/webkickstart if you have that installed in the normal
place), your master Public/Private keys (which I don't think I have a tool
to generate), a secret (any random string), and some other NCSU specific stuff.

* Read doc/config.txt to learn about setting up Apache to use the
  cherrypy/genshi/xmlrpc based web app.

* Take the client/ directory and change constants.py to include the
  URL to the XMLRPC interface and see if the client can communicate.

* Test out the web site.
